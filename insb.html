            <p>Synthesize InSb semiconductor via solid-state synthesis, using solid Indium
                (In) and Antimony (Sb) pieces as precursors, and to deposit a thin film using
                the TVD technique.</p>

            <div class="section-header">Synthesis process</div>
            <p>The precursors are ground in an agate mortar and pestle for 1h to get a
                homogeneous mixture then form a pallet. Place the pallet inside box furnace. Heat the furnace so that both atoms can diffuse and form the solid solution. Do the annealing and we get 
            pallet of InSb. Place the pallet inside the TVD chamber then deposit film using TVD</p>

            <div class="section-header">Characterization</div>
            <p>Bulk sample was characterized using X-ray diffraction and four probe method is
                used to find the band gap of the Indium antimonide sample. Thin film was used
                to calculate the hall voltage using the hall effect and to find the grain size and
                thickness of the film, SEM was performed. To find the composition EDAX was
                performed. XRD was also performed on the as-deposited thin film of the InSb sample.

                The plot shown in figure 5 shows some sharp peaks but also one broad distribu-
                tion which signifies that the film has some amorphous nature to overcome that,
                
                annealing should be performed, which makes the molecule mobile and allow it to
                take the specific place and form a lattice which makes the film crystalline and then
                sharp peaks will be obtained since lattice is formed.</p>
                <p>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed on a thin film to
                    determine the grain size of InSb and thickness of the film. The resolution was
                    500 nm and the magnification was 100000X at the time of measuring grain sizes,
                    the sizes ranged from 70 nm to 115 nm. The thickness was measured using cross
                    sample holder so that the electron beam hit the film side way under the resolution
                    of 5 μm and the magnification was 20000x. The thickness measured was 2 μm
                    to 2.25 μm.</p>
                <p>EDAX was performed to get the elemental composition (by weight) of Indium
                    and Antimony from the Indium antimonide. It was found to be 47.8 % of Indium
                    and 52.2 % of Antimony in Indium antimonide (by weight) as shown in fig 8b.
                    Mole percent is 49.2 % of In and 50.8 % of Sb.</p>

            <p>Indium antimonide was successfully prepared using the solid-state synthesis.
                We found the band gap of the sample as 0.158 eV which is close to the actual
                band gap of 0.17 eV. Since the band gap of InSb is in the range of infrared
                light, it can be used in the photodetector of infrared light on in some thermal
                imaging devices.</p>
                <p>
                    XRD was performed on the sample which shows the peak and when peaks
were matched with JCPDs data. It shows that most of the reactants were
converted to product and crystalline InSb is formed with a very small amount
of precursor left as shown in XRD here two small unmarked peaks corresponding to precursors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EDAX confirms the presence of equimolar content of Indium and Antimony
in the final compound and that confirms the stoichiometry of the sample as
InSb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grain size of the deposited sample in the film is in the range from 70 nm to
115 nm.
